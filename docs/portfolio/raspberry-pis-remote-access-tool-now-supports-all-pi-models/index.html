<p>Seo: Raspberry Pi Connect Now Supports 32-bit Devices
excerpt: Support for 32-bit devices was not available at launch.</p>
<p>————</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been just over a month since the launch of Raspberry Pi Connect, an official remote access tool that allows you to control your Pi computer from a web browser. Today,  Raspberry Pi Connect is rolling out support for 32-bit Pi computers. The new Connect release also includes a remote shell access feature.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi Connect was limited to 64-bit Pi computers at launch. In other words, it only worked on the Pi 4, Pi 5, and Pi 400. Newfound 32-bit support brings Connect to <em>all</em> models of Pi computer, including the original Raspberry Pi from 2012, the tiny Raspberry Pi Zero, and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big caveat here—remote desktop functionality doesn&rsquo;t work on 32-bit Pi models. If you set up Raspberry Pi Connect with an old 32-bit SBC, you will be limited to remote shell access (which is itself a new feature). This is also true of 64-bit Pi computers that haven&rsquo;t been updated to Pi OS Bookworm, as remote desktop requires a Wayland compositor. (So, a Pi 4 that hasn&rsquo;t been updated to the latest OS version cannot use desktop mirroring.)</p>
<p>I doubt that these limitations will be a &ldquo;problem.&rdquo; Remote shell access from a terminal window is more convenient and powerful than desktop mirroring. And because 32-bit Pi models are often relegated to headless applications, the lack of desktop mirroring may go unnoticed by most users. You can&rsquo;t mirror a desktop that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi team confirms that advanced Pi Connect functionality, including remote file transfer, are currently in development. I&rsquo;m surprised that remote file transfer wasn&rsquo;t included at launch, but maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter, as FireZilla and other FTP applications already fill this role.</p>
<p>You can set up Pi Connect by following the instructions listed in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html">Raspberry Pi Documentation</a>. The setup process is incredibly easy and should only take you a few minutes. Note that remote desktop and shell access functionality are still in beta and suffer from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html#known-issues">some known issues</a>. Also, users may encounter latency when relaying is required, as Pi Connect currently relies on just one TURN relay server.</p>
